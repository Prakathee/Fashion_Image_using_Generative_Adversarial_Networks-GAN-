# Fashion_Image_using_Generative_Adversarial_Networks-GAN-

• Created a GAN with TensorFlow to generate fashion images, employing LeakyReLU and dropout layers for improved results.
• Orchestrated a GAN training regimen over 1800 epochs, implementing binary cross-entropy loss and Adam optimization,
demonstrating adeptness in hyperparameter tuning and model convergence techniques.
